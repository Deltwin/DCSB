# README
If you come across any bug, something stops working or the program crashes please create issue here or to: https://t.me/DeItwin
Include as much information as you can provide (any error messages, what stopped working, what were you doing when it happened, what version you are using...). 
Usually restarting the program/running it as an administrator helps. 
If you will remove some files (As dll or XML) the software will not start or crash.
